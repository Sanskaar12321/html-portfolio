<h1>The best movies according to Sanskaar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time are:</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
<p>This movie features Hritik Roshan, Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar, Kalki Koechlin<br> and Katrina Kaif.<br/>
    It is a movie where the three school friends go to Spain on a<br> bachellorette trip of one of them according to the pact they had made.
</p>
<h3>Karwaan</h3>
<p>This is a feel good movie that revoloves around the unexpected and chance road<br> trip of a young engineer in South India who 
    needs to get the corpse<br/> of his dad from a woman in a farway hill-station as her mother's body is delivered to him.<br/> This exchange caused 
    due to the mistake of the <br/>logistics co. leads to a splendid adventure.
</p>
<h3>Knight and Day</h3>
<p>Just another action-packed Tom Cruise movie with Cameron Diaz featured <br/>  as the co-star.</p>
